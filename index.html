        <p id="tribute-info"><span class="L">L</span>eonardo da Vinci April 15 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519 was
        an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever
        to have lived. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his
        notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on science and invention; these involve a variety of subjects including
        anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance
        humanist idea,[6] and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that
        of his contemporary Michelangelo.
        
        Properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci,Leonardo was born out of wedlock to a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a
        peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci, in the region of Florence, Italy. Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned
        Italian painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in
        Milan, and he later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice. He spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519.
